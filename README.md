# ClickerGame
This is a python code. It uses PyQT6 for GUI. It is a simple clicking game where you have to keep clicking to win. Every click is +1 pts and while you do not click, you lose points( -1 pts). There is a 30 second countdown. If you are able to keep the count > 0 then you win. Otherwise you lose.
